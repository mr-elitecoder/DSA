## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily from **LeetCode**.

The goal of this project is to:

- Implement standard algorithms from scratch (Sorting, Searching, etc.).
- Provide optimized solutions to competitive programming problems.
- Demonstrate proficiency in **C++** and memory management.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized by topic. Each folder contains solutions relevant to that category. currently my folder structure following Apna College DSA Sheet :

```text
📦 DSA
 ┣ 📂 arrays        # Array manipulation problems
 ┣ 📂 sorting       # Sorting algorithms
 ┗ 📜 .gitignore
```
